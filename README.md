============

Predictability of measles epidemics in small populations, using TSIR model fitting and simulation.

Files and Directories
---------------------

*batch.py*

Main Python script for processing an entire directory of data. Arguments : `directory_name number_sims` 
where `directory_name` is a directory in /data, and `number_sims` is an integer number of simulations to run 
for each time series.

*TSIR_smallpop.R*

Main R script for processing time series. Ayesha ? :P

*raw_data/*

All raw data collected from stats agencies ( or Bryan ) go here for permanent storage, so I don't lose them 
again...

*data/*

Processed data in a form useable by all scripts, and hopefully ssm at some point.
