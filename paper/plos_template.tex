\section*{Introduction}

Needs padding and fixing...

Measles is a highly contagious and strongly immunizing infection of the respiratory system. Due to its extreme transmissibility, its epidemiology is conditional on the birth of susceptible individuals. As such, the temporal dynamics of measles are typically strongly oscillatory, driven seasonally by the increased contact rate amongst children during school periods, assuming the population is large enough to sustain the disease (Black FL, 1966, JTB 11). These dynamics have been well studied (Grenfell papers, others), and many modelling efforts have successfully explained the biennial cycle exhibited in prevaccination records of measles incidence in Europe and elsewhere (papers ?). 

In small populations, where the number of individuals is much smaller than the critical community size required to support an endemic infection, however, the dynamics of measles cases are vastly different. Susceptible individuals accumulate when measles is absent; then, driven by stochastic importation, an epidemic may sweep through a large fraction of the susceptible population very quickly, only to go extinct abruptly as susceptibles become depleted. This results in very sharp, spiky epidemics, the timing of which may be impossible to predict, but the size and duration of which may be a function of historical data. 

In this paper, we address the question of predictability of measles epidemics in small populations, based on records of past incidence and on demographic data. We present data on the demographics and disease incidence in prevaccination-era Bornholm, the Faroe Islands, and four districts in Iceland. 

reconstruct the dynamics of susceptible individuals and infer the rate of reporting of cases using the TSIR model (Finkelstadt and Grenfell 2000) in prevaccination
